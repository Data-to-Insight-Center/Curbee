  "abstract": "A 4-meter diameter, 80-cm wide rotating debris flow flume was constructed at the University of California Richmond Field Station for studying large-scale granular flow phenomena. This dataset covers the experiments conducted in 2007 and 2008, where the primary goal was to study rates and mechanisms of bedrock erosion by debris flows.  \n\nThe following data will be posted at the NCED Repository:\n(Please see the temporary folder for now: \nhttps://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B5JYwkWgsLhRSDl5aGRUd2lYVG8/edit )\n\n1. Master list of experiments\n2. Force plate data\n3. Laser profile data\n4. Erosion topography data\n5. Videos\n6. MATLAB scripts\n\nLast updated 2012/07/15\n\n***\n\n1. 01-debrisflow_mastertable.xls lists the experiment number, unique ID (YYMMDD), description, effective diameter, and bulk flow velocity.\n\n2. to be deposited\n\n3. to be deposited\n\n4. to be deposited\n\n5a. Debris Flow Flume videos\n05a-debrisflow-drum-videos.zip: ,asf videos (can be played with the VLC player:http://www.videolan.org/vlc/) labeled as YYMMDD-MMSS_start-MMSS_end.\n\n5b. Granular Flow and Debris Flow Video Examples\n05b-debrisflow-drum-videos.zip: These are .wmv files of field and laboratory granular flows and debris flows. The purpose of these videos is to show the great range in behavior of granular and debris flow. Videos were taken at the Illgraben Torrent, (a debris flow channel in Switzerland), in the large rotating debris flow flume (Big Wheel) at the Richmond Field Station, University of California, Berkeley, and in the small rotating debris flow flume (Maytag) at the Richmond Field Station.\n\n6. to be deposited\n\nFor more information contact: hsu.leslie@gmail.com",
